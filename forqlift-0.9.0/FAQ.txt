WHAT IS FORQLIFT?

forqlift is a tool for managing SequenceFiles.

If you work with Hadoop (or products built on Hadoop, such as
Mahout), there’s a chance you work with SequenceFiles.

In turn, if you work with SequenceFiles a lot and want an
interface similar to the familiar tar or zip commands, forqlift
is for you.

WHAT’S A SEQUENCEFILE, AND WHY WOULD I USE ONE?

A SequenceFile is a Hadoop-specific archive format, similar to
tar or zip.

Hadoop typically works on text data, treating each line as a
record (a key/value pair). If you’re processing text
line-by-line, this is pretty natural: split the line on some
delimiter (say, a tab or a comma) to define “key” and “value” and
you Hadoop away.

What if you want to use Hadoop’s parallel-processing muscle on
binary data (images, videos, sound files, or anything else you
can see as a series of bytes)? or what if you need to treat an
entire text file (such as an XML document) as a single record?

That’s when you’d use a SequenceFile. Hadoop treats the contents
of a SequenceFile as records of key/value pairs. (For example: if
you’re feeding Hadoop a series of images, the “key” could be the
filename and the “value” could be the image’s raw bytes.)

As an additional benefit, SequenceFiles are very efficient for
Hadoop because you can ship lots of small files to and from the
cluster as a single package.

WHERE DO I GET FORQLIFT?

forqlift’s homepage at http://www.exmachinatech.net/go/forqlift
has links for downloading.

## - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - WHAT DO I NEED TO RUN
FORQLIFT?

forqlift requires Java runtime (JRE) 1.6.

If you’re running under Windows, forqlift also requires a cygwin
install that includes the chmod command. (This is a requirement
of the underlying Hadoop code, not of forqlift itself.)

Please note that forqlift does not require a Hadoop install, nor
a Hadoop cluster! forqlift uses the Hadoop libraries on the
backend, but those are included in the product.

forqlift is released under the popular Apache License, Version
2.0.

You can see the text of this license in the LICENSE.txt file
included in the distribution, or online at one of the Apache

WHY DID YOU WRITE FORQLIFT?

In a nutshell: it all started when I was churning XML data
through Mahout (Apache’s library of machine-learning algorithms).
Mahout uses Hadoop on the backend, and therefore it likes to read
data from SequenceFiles. Mahout’s basic tools for loading data
into SequenceFiles were fine, but I wanted something with a bit
more heft. So I wrote forqlift.

WHAT’S WITH THE NAME, "FORQLIFT?"

It’s a play on the term “forklift.” Forklifts, like
SequenceFiles, can be used to move things in bulk.

I tossed in the “q” because that letter appears in the term
“SequenceFile.”

CAN I SUGGEST A FEATURE FOR FORQLIFT?

Please do! forqlift is still in its early stages. (I plan to
tackle some cleanup before I add new features, but feel free to
share your thoughts and use cases. That will help set future
direction.)
